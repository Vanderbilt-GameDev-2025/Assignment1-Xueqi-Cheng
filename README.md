This is the Assignment1 for Xueqi Cheng

## Introduction

The assignment is to create a 2D platformer game using Godot. The game is to control the warrior to reach the final point through platforms while getting as many coins as possible. There are enemies (birds) in the game, and the player should avoid touching them. Some platforms are moving. The game is over when the player touches the enemy or falls off the platform.
